If a student experiences barriers to full participation or fair evaluation due to a disability, they should inform the instructor so that accommodations can be made. It is also important to inform the instructor early on in the quarter to ensure that appropriate accommodations can be provided. If there are any other obstacles to full participation, students are encouraged to share their concerns with the instructor."
